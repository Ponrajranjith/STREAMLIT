# Project_2_Streamlit_project

Creating a Streamlit project involving Pillow, requests, and Lottie can be a fascinating way to build an interactive web application. Here’s a basic description to get you started:


**Description:**
Develop a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload an image, apply various Pillow image manipulations, and display the modified image with animation using Lottie.

**Features:**
1. **Image Upload:** Users can upload an image from their local system.
2. **Pillow Image Manipulation:** Apply different image manipulations using Pillow (e.g., resizing, rotating, applying filters).
3. **Display Modified Image:** Show the modified image to the user within the web application.
4. **Lottie Animation:** Use Lottie to add animation effects to the displayed image (e.g., animated borders, effects).
5. **User Interaction:** Allow users to select different manipulation options and see the real-time changes.

**Modules/Libraries:**
1. **Streamlit:** Use Streamlit for creating the web interface.
2. **Pillow:** Utilize Pillow for image manipulation tasks.
3. **Requests:** Integrate requests for handling image upload from the user.
4. **Lottie:** Incorporate Lottie for adding animations to the displayed image.

**Example Flow:**
1. Create a Streamlit app layout with an upload button for users to select an image.
2. Once the image is uploaded, provide options for different Pillow manipulations (e.g., resize, rotate, apply filters).
3. Upon selecting a manipulation, display the modified image.
4. Use Lottie to add animated effects to the modified image.
5. Allow users to switch between different manipulations and observe the real-time changes in the displayed image with animation.

**Additional Challenges:**
- Implement multiple image manipulation options simultaneously (e.g., resizing and applying filters).
- Allow users to download the modified image.
- Create a sidebar for additional settings or advanced manipulation options.
- Add image comparison functionality to display the original and modified images side by side.

This project combines multiple libraries and tools to create an engaging web application that involves image processing, manipulation, and animation. It's an excellent way to practice integrating different libraries within a Streamlit application while providing a user-friendly interface for image editing.
